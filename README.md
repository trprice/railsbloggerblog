# Rails Blogger Blog

## Description
This project is intended to be a trial run of programming in Ruby on Rails for me and for communicating with another service through their API.

My current requirements are:
1. Connect to the Blogger API
1. Pull down the published blogs at regular intervals
1. Display them nicely.

I will update this list of requirements as I work my way through the project (and that statement will test my ability to maintain documentation).

## Version Information
* Ruby: 2.5.1
* Rails: 5.2
